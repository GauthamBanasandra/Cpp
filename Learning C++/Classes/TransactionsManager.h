	* The parameter represents a reference to a Transaction object which is constant.
	* In C++, parameters are passed by value. Any change made to the parameter in the called fuction isn't reflected to that in the callling function. 
	* Also, the object contents are physically copied when they are passed as parameters to functions.
	* You can pass just the reference by suffixing an &. All changes to object in called function are reflected in the calling function.
	* But making it a const will ensure that the function doesn't alter its contents.
	* In short, a constant refrence avoids copying of parameters also protects it against unintended data manipulation.
	* Parameters are passed without any special qualifications. e.g. tm.AddTransaction(t);
